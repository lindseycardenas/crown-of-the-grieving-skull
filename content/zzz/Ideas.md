Demigod -Fildarae

- Elf that worshipped Labelas, but thought that he wasn't using his power to it's full potential
- Stole the Timestave, got caught, was exiled to astral sea
- became astral elf
- years pass, but from what she learned studying varies things, she learns that if he can harness the essence of a planet, she can basically create psuedo time magic, with the goal of if this works, she can replicate it with different planets till she is strong enough to get revenge on the elves that casted her out
- get to Elunia, as she can sense a strong magical essence within the planet
- creates a Divine Realm under the capital of the Astridia
- begins harnessing the essence of the planet into a crystal
- since time magic is very delicate, she would get test subjects to test the crystals capabilities, though none were able to actually make it work, until she convinced the king, who had just lost his wife, to try the crystal. This yielded the best result and learned that love was the best catalyst for this type of pseudo magic.
- by having the king continuously use the crystal, every subsequent time would charge the crystal faster, draining the earths essence quicker
- until this final time when the crystal finally broke due to it not being able to fully contain the pseudo magic
- the elf hypothisised that if she could fuse someones soul that had divine magic to the crystal, it might be enough to be able to fix the damage and increase its storage capabilities
- Raina is used to unleash crystals full potential
- before the fusion begins, Raina destroys a part of the crystal and sends the shards and Kaz into a portal
- unable to locate the shards due to a cloaking spell cast by Raina, she uses her magic to send out shadows to locate the crystals
- because of this she can no longer leave the divine realm
- in order to search for the crystals, she slowly corrupts the 5 monarchs of the realm, creating the Hourglass Coven
- The Witchlight carnival comes to Elunia, a carnival that travels the material plane
- The carnival is run by an astral elf named Saelethil, who got control of the carnival through swindling its previous owners. Once the previous owner found out, he put a bounty out on him which is why the carnival is always on the move.
- Fildarae finds this out and says if he doesnâ€™t cooperate then she will alert the bounty hunters to him
- saelethil reluctantly agrees to help find the missing crystals
- Not fully trusting his cooperation, she sends a Kenku to keep an eye on him
