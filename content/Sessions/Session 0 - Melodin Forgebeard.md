# Recap

# Summary

- Introduce world
- Start in main town
- Melodin will be on some sort of retrieval quest for Grondar
- Towns people will be wary since they know Grondar as a traitor to his clan

- Though they aren’t keen on fighting, they are still not sure of Grondar since he came from a clan known for fighting

- Once Melodin get back to Grondars, have them go out hunting in the mountain.

- Prepare some beasts for this
- Prepare some shadow creatures as well, that they are both surprised to see

- On the way back, have Grondar and Melodin have a touching moment somehow
- Once they return to Grondars home, tell Melodin to meet him in the morning, as he has something he wants to give him

- Grondar is planning to leave, as the gemstone that he had found in a hidden cave is beginning to pulse and seeming to pull him towards something and may have to do with the shadow creature he encountered before

- Melodin gets to Grondars the next morning, but he has seemingly up and left
- Just then the war bells ring, a shadow creature invasion

- Try to give Melodin some options on if he wants to fight this or run

- Either way, the town is soon over taken by shadows, since these dwarfs aren’t very good at combat
- Melodin runs out of town, only to encounter Grondar engaged with an unknown entity
- Before he can act, Grondar is killed, but not before one last exchange of words and Grondar throwing the crystal to Melodin
- The unknown entity then changes his attention to Melodin
- It is here that Melodin is pulled through a tear in the space behind him and sucked through, to end up at the Witchlight Carnival.
