-Who is Remulous

- Remulous is the emperor of [[Elunia]] a once revered king known for his wisdom, valor, and benevolence towards his subjects. His reign brought stability and prosperity to the realm, and he was beloved by his people.

- Queen [[Fiorei]] a Divine Soul Sorcerer, was his one true love, but she met an untimely death

- driven by grief, Remulous sought out a way to bring her back

- no magic he studied had any way to do this, even necromancy couldn't bring her back

- one day a robed figure approached him, and tells him that deep within the earth is a power that can help reunite him and [[Fiorei]]

- after years of searching, he finds the spirit tree, a tree that controls the flow of time of the planet
- using this magic, he is able to rewind the flow of time
- nothing made him happier than being with [[Fiorei]] once again
- but tragedy struck again and [[Fiorei]] passed
- Remulous would set out again to find this magic
- time and time again he would rewind time only to be met with the same fate
- the last time he used the magic, it caused the crystal that was housing it to shatter, causing rifts to open across all of Elunia, and the magic to no longer work
- no longer able to rewind time, and a world shattered, Remulous finally snapped
- A once revered king, now overtaken with rage and grief, has set out once again to find a way to repair the crystal
- after what felt like a hopeless endeavor, he discovered a Sorcerer that was studying Chronurgy magic, an extremely rare magic
- He later discovers that the sorcerer is also attuned with a Divine Soul
- He eventually is able to fuse the sorcerer and the crystal together to once again control the flow of time
- but before he can, the sorcerer breaks off a chunk of crystal and shatters it into 5 pieces, then uses magic to scatter 3 shards across the realm, and send 2 with he beloved knight who she sends through a portal to the astral sea
- now with a shattered crystal again, he sends his loyal armies to find the missing shards

What does he want

- to fuse the missing shards with the crystal and attempt to be with his love once again

Why his goal is causing a threat

- he is destroying the realm of Elunia looking for these shards, also caused the spatial rifts to open, further destroying things

Solution

- collect the shards, defeat Remulous, fix the crystal and return the flow of time to the world
