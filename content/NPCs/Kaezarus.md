Kazaerus, a valiant knight with a heart of gold, was entrusted with the sacred duty of protecting the sorceress Raina from a tender age. Bound by honor and loyalty, he swore to shield her from any harm that dared to approach. Raina, gifted with potent magic, relied on Kazaerus's steadfast presence for safety and guidance.

Their bond was forged through years of trials and tribulations, as they traversed treacherous lands and faced countless dangers together. Kazaerus's unwavering dedication to Raina became the cornerstone of their unbreakable alliance.

However, their peaceful existence was soon disrupted when they were summoned to the royal court by the king himself. Little did they know, the king harbored sinister intentions, seeking to exploit Raina's formidable powers for his own selfish gain.

As they stood before the king, Kazaerus sensed the dark undercurrents of the monarch's desires. With a steadfast resolve, he vowed to protect Raina at all costs, even if it meant challenging the very ruler they were sworn to serve.
