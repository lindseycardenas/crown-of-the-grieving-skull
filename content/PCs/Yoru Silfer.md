In the depths of a dank and forgotten dungeon, amidst the cold stone walls and flickering torchlight, there existed a solitary existence—a plasmoid, a creature of radiant energy confined to the confines of its subterranean prison. For ages untold, it languished in darkness, its luminous form a stark contrast to the gloom that surrounded it.

Yet, fate's capricious hand reached out, grasping the plasmoid in its unfathomable embrace and wrenching it from the depths of its captivity. Through the whims of fate or the machinations of unseen forces, the plasmoid found itself hurtling through the void, traversing the boundaries between worlds until it emerged in a realm altogether unfamiliar—a world of lush greenery and towering mountains, where the air was thick with the scent of ancient magic and whispered legends.

As the plasmoid materialized in this new realm, it found itself nestled within a graveyard, a silent testament to the passage of time and the inevitability of mortality. Here, behind the weathered stones and crumbling mausoleums, stood a shrine dedicated to the diety of death, Mortalis the Eternal Guide, worshipped by the inhabitants of a nearby village with devout reverence.

Upon discovering the plasmoid amidst the sacred grounds, the villagers were overcome with awe and wonder, interpreting its sudden appearance as a divine sign from their revered deity. With hearts filled with reverence and souls ablaze with fervent faith, they gathered around the plasmoid, hailing it as the embodiment of their beloved god of death.

Amidst the throng of worshippers stood a solitary figure—a priest named Yoru, dedicated to the service of the shrine and the deity it honored. With a mixture of trepidation and curiosity, the priest approached the plasmoid, sensing a palpable energy radiating from its luminous form. In the depths of his soul, he felt a calling, a whisper of divine guidance urging him to embrace this otherworldly visitor.

With unwavering faith and steadfast devotion, the priest took the plasmoid under his care, sheltering it within the confines of the shrine. There, amidst the flickering candlelight and the echoes of ancient prayers, he tended to the plasmoid, offering it the same reverence and respect afforded to the deity it was believed to represent.

Yet, as whispers of the plasmoid's presence spread beyond the village, they reached the ears of a central religious authority, The Orthodoxy of the Eternal Light—a zealous order dedicated to upholding the orthodoxy of their faith at any cost. Viewing the plasmoid's worship as a heresy that threatened to undermine their control, they dispatched their inquisitors to investigate the matter with ruthless efficiency.

With accusations of blasphemy and heresy ringing in their ears, the inquisitors descended upon the shrine, their eyes ablaze with righteous fervor. They branded the priest a traitor to their faith, accusing him of perverting the teachings of their religion with his idolatry of the plasmoid. In a swift and brutal display of their authority, they seized the priest and subjected him to the cruel whims of their judgment.

In the shadow of the shrine, amidst the silent whispers of the departed and the solemn gaze of the plasmoid, the priest met his end—a martyr to his faith, beaten to death by the inquisitors' merciless hands. And as his life ebbed away, so too did the fragile peace of the village, shattered by the tyranny of those who sought to extinguish the light of belief in the name of their own dogma.
