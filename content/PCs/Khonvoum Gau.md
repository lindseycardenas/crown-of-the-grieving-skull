# Backstory

In the vast, star-strewn void of the multiverse, a figure stands tall among the ranks of the Giff, a species known for their imposing stature, elephantine features, and a love for explosions and firearms. This figure is Khonvoum, a Giff Ranger who has taken the mantle of a Horizon Walker, patrolling the boundaries between worlds and protecting the cosmos from threats that lurk in the interdimensional shadows.

Khonvoum's story begins on the floating fortress-city of Zephyrion, a massive structure drifting through the Astral Sea, home to the Giff military elite. Born into a distinguished line of soldiers, Khonvoum was raised amidst the thunder of cannons and the strategic doctrines of interstellar warfare. From a young age, he showed an uncanny affinity for the wilderness of the cosmos, navigating the asteroid fields and nebula forests with ease.

His prowess did not go unnoticed. The Horizon Walkers, an elite group of rangers tasked with guarding the fabric of reality itself, saw in Khonvoum a potential recruit. Under their tutelage, he mastered the art of stepping through the veils between worlds, using his abilities to ambush enemies and scout ahead in complete obscurity.

Khonvoum's life changed during the Battle of the Shattered Moons. A coalition of fiendish entities sought to tear a rift into the Material Plane, aiming to unleash chaos across the galaxy. Leading a squad of Horizon Walkers, Khonvoum fought valiantly, utilizing his spatial manipulation skills to outmaneuver and decimate the enemy forces. It was during this battle that he earned his moniker, "The Void Strider," for his ability to emerge from the nothingness of space and strike fear into the hearts of his foes.

After the victory, Khonvoum didn't return to a hero's welcome but to a silent contemplation of the vastness of his duty. He realized that his fight was not just for the glory of the Giff or the protection of the Material Plane but for the balance of the entire multiverse. With his bandolier of magically imbued ammunition, a rifle capable of shooting through the fabric of reality, and a heart brave enough to face the unknown, Khonvoum now roams the cosmic wilderness, on the Mercenary ship called The Second Wind standing guard over the myriad paths that weave through existence.

His comrades are the stars, his home is the void, and his enemies are those who dare to threaten the cosmic order. Khonvoum, the Horizon Walker, remains vigilant, a space marine not bound by planet or country, but by the unending expanse of the multiverse itself.
