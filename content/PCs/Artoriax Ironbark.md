Artoriax Ironbark's story begins in the dense forests surrounding the city of Darkgrove, a settlement deeply devoted to the deity Stronmaus. One fateful day, a group of wandering adventurers stumbled upon a curious sight in the heart of the forest: a lone dragonborn egg nestled among the roots of an ancient tree. Surrounded by signs of struggle and danger, it was clear that whatever had laid the egg was no longer present.

Moved by compassion and curiosity, the adventurers, led by a seasoned Cleric named Narvi, decided to take the egg with them back to Darkgrove. Little did they know that this decision would forever change the course of their lives and the life of the dragonborn they would come to call Artoriax Ironbark.

In Darkgrove, Artoriax was welcomed into the fold of the city's community, raised by Narvi and some of the other adventurers who found him. Despite his draconic nature, he quickly became a beloved member of the city, known for his kind heart, fierce loyalty, and unwavering determination.

As he grew, Artoriax's bond with Narvi deepened, with the Cleric taking on the role of mentor, father figure, and closest friend. Under Narvi's guidance, Artoriax learned the ways of the wilderness, honing his skills in survival, combat, and diplomacy.

Yet, despite the warmth and acceptance he found in Darkgrove, Artoriax couldn't shake the lingering questions about his origins. He often found himself gazing out over the forest, wondering where he had come from and what fate had befallen his birth parents.

Driven by a restless longing to uncover the truth of his past, Artoriax embarked on numerous quests and adventures, journeying far and wide in search of clues about his origins. Along the way, he faced countless dangers, forged powerful alliances, and unearthed ancient secrets hidden in the far corners of the world.

But no matter how far he traveled or how many mysteries he unraveled, the truth of Artoriax's past remained elusive, shrouded in the mists of time and mystery. Yet, with Narvi by his side and the spirit of adventure burning bright in his heart, Artoriax vowed to continue his quest, knowing that the answers he sought lay waiting somewhere beyond the horizon, just out of reach but never beyond his grasp.

# Narvi

Narvi, the Cleric who found Artoriax's dragonborn egg, had a story that intertwined with the fate of Darkgrove itself. Born into a family of devout followers of Stronmaus, Narvi was raised within the sacred halls of the city's temple, where he learned the ways of faith, healing, and divine magic from a young age.

As he grew, Narvi felt a deep calling to serve his deity and his community, dedicating himself to the protection and well-being of Darkgrove and its inhabitants. His unwavering devotion and natural talent for the arcane arts soon caught the attention of the temple's high priest, who took Narvi under his wing as his apprentice.

Under the tutelage of the high priest, Narvi honed his skills as a healer and a guardian, mastering the arts of divine magic and spiritual guidance. Yet, despite his deep connection to the temple and its teachings, Narvi felt a restless longing stirring within him, a desire to explore the world beyond the confines of Darkgrove and seek out adventure beyond the walls of the city.

It was during one of his journeys into the wilderness surrounding Darkgrove that Narvi stumbled upon the dragonborn egg, nestled among the roots of an ancient tree. Moved by a powerful sense of compassion and duty, Narvi knew in his heart that he had been chosen by Stronmaus to protect and raise the hatchling as his own.

Bringing the egg back to Darkgrove, Narvi devoted himself wholeheartedly to caring for the young dragonborn, raising him within the walls of the temple and teaching him the ways of faith, compassion, and courage. Over the years, their bond deepened into a father-son relationship, with Narvi guiding Artoriax with wisdom, love, and unwavering support.

But, Narvi's past held a dark secret that he had concealed from everyone, even Artoriax himself. Before he found the dragonborn egg, Narvi had been a renowned bounty hunter, feared and respected for his skills in tracking and combat. His latest contract had led him to the forests surrounding Darkgrove, where he had been tasked with wiping out Artoriax's entire dragonborn clan.

Driven by a sense of duty and the promise of gold, Narvi had pursued his quarry relentlessly, hunting down the members of Artoriax's clan one by one. Yet, when he stumbled upon the lone dragonborn egg hidden among the roots of an ancient tree, something within him shifted. In that moment, Narvi knew that he could not carry out his mission. Instead, he felt a powerful surge of compassion and protectiveness towards the helpless hatchling, a feeling that eclipsed his desire for gold or vengeance.

Choosing to defy his orders and follow his heart, Narvi made the fateful decision to take the dragonborn egg back to Darkgrove, where he would raise the hatchling as his own son. Yet, even as he embraced his new role as Artoriax's guardian and mentor, Narvi could never shake the guilt and shame that weighed heavily on his soul.

Haunted by the memory of his past actions, Narvi resolved to keep his dark secret buried deep within him, shielding Artoriax from the painful truth of his origins. Though he knew that the truth would eventually come to light, Narvi remained determined to protect Artoriax from the shadows of his past, to guide him towards a future filled with light, love, and hope.
